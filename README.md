# Water My Plant
Given the abject aversion to take responsibilities, 
this code exists to water my flatmate's plant. 
This is the backend service which operates solely from the raspberry-pi which is giving the plant company.

Written in go, using pi-blaster it operates a stepper motor to water the plant.

## Why?
As mentioned before, this exists to water my flatmate's plant.
This is also an exercise to: 
1. Learning GoLang for starters.
2. Interfacing with Raspberry-Pi using pi-blaster
3. Discipline for personal projects

## How?
Later
